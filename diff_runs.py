diff_runs.py
------------
Diff two binance-scraper JSON outputs of the same mode by `sku`.

    added      in the new run, not the old one
    removed    in the old run, not the new one
    changed    in both, with a tracked column that differs

What each means depends on the mode, and it is worth being exact:

    p2p            an advert that appeared or went away, or whose price,
                   limits or remaining quantity moved. P2P moves by the
                   minute, so a diff an hour apart is mostly `changed`.
    copytrading    a portfolio entering or leaving the slice the run fetched,
                   or its figures moving. `removed` does NOT mean closed: a
                   run fetches the first N of ~8,900 portfolios under one
                   ordering, and a portfolio can fall below the cut.
    announcements  a new article (`added`), or one the catalogue dropped.

**The tracked columns are DERIVED from the row class, not listed by hand.**
A hand-written list here is how a sibling family of repos came to report
"0 changed" on real changes for weeks: the list had been copied from a repo
whose rows had different columns, and every field it named was absent from
both sides, so every comparison was None == None. So TRACKED_FIELDS is
"every column of the mode's row class, minus the ones that describe the run
rather than the thing" (UNTRACKED_FIELDS), and a check asserts it is never
empty.

Refused, with --force as the escape hatch:
  * runs that are not both `complete` — a short run's unfetched pages read as
    `removed`;
  * runs of different modes — their rows share no columns worth comparing;
  * runs of different QUERIES (asset/fiat/side, period/ordering, catalogue),
    from the sidecar — every line would describe the query change.
