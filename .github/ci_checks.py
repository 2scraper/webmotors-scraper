CI checks that are too long to live inside the workflow YAML.

They started out as heredocs in `.github/workflows/tests.yml` and moved here
for one practical reason: a Python block nested inside YAML inside a shell
`run:` needs three levels of quoting to stay intact, and shell-quoted regexes
like '(ws|wss)://[^ "'"'"']+' do not survive being copied through a browser.
A separate .py file is copy-paste safe, runs locally, and can be read on its
own.

Run any of these from the repo root:

    python .github/ci_checks.py --help-check
    python .github/ci_checks.py --sample-check
    python .github/ci_checks.py --secret-check
    python .github/ci_checks.py --all

Each prints what it looked at and exits non-zero on failure.

    `secret_check` reads the working tree, which is the right scope for CI:
    it fails a pull request before the mistake lands. This one is for the
    step CI cannot do anything about — publishing.

    A commit on top cannot reach what a published tag and a merged PR's refs
    already hold; those stay attached to the PR and cannot be deleted from
    it. So the decision has to be made BEFORE the repository goes public,
    and afterwards only a fresh repository removes anything. Run this then:

        python .github/ci_checks.py --history-check

    Deliberately NOT part of `--all` and not run by CI. It shells out to git
    once per object, which is fine for a hundred and wasteful on every push,
    and a repo whose history is dirty needs a decision rather than a red
    check.
