# Builds the Playwright engine (the one the README recommends) into a
# container with its own Chromium — for a CI canary run or a scheduled job,
# not required for local development (`pip install` directly is simpler there).
#
#   docker build -t webmotors-scraper .
#   docker run --rm -v "$PWD/out:/out" -e WEBMOTORS_PROXY webmotors-scraper \
#     --make volkswagen --model gol --pages 3 --out /out/gol
#
# The site refuses datacentre addresses, so the container needs a
# RESIDENTIAL proxy (WEBMOTORS_PROXY, passed through from your shell with
# `-e`) or a Scraping Browser endpoint (WEBMOTORS_CDP_ENDPOINT).
#
# Pass --proxy/--twocaptcha-key the same way as running locally, or mount a
# .env at /app/.env — nothing here bakes in a credential.
