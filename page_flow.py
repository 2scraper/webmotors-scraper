------------
The retry / solve / blocked decision, as DATA rather than as three copies of
an if-chain (CLAUDE.md §1).

binance.com answers one of this repo's requests in eight ways, and they want
six different responses:

    the endpoint's JSON with rows in it                 -> parse
    the same JSON with no rows                          -> parse, it is an answer
    the JSON with a non-success `code`, or HTTP 400     -> stop: the PARAMETERS
                                                           were refused, and a
                                                           retry sends them again
    AWS WAF: 202 + x-amzn-waf-action, or its CAPTCHA    -> solve, or rotate
    429 / 418                                           -> wait, same exit
    451                                                 -> rotate: the site
                                                           refuses the exit's
                                                           jurisdiction
    403                                                 -> rotate
    anything else                                       -> retry

Three copies of that triage across three engines would drift, and the drift
would be silent: one engine reporting exit 3 where its twin reports exit 0
on the same response.

Nothing here imports a browser, and **no JavaScript crosses this boundary**
(§1). Each engine spells its fetch() in its own driver's dialect.
